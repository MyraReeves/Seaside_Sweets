This is an ongoing personal expansion project inspired by a 2023 school assignment.  The original Javascript homework had been a single page of mock sales data designed to integrate objects literals, constructor functions, tables, and forms.  I decided to expand the mock website into multiple pages to gain further practice using JavaScript and CSS.

## Sources

All images were obtained using the "Public Domain" filter on DuckDuckGo's image search. I visually verified on the provider websites that each was labelled as having a "Public Domain License" and/or "free for personal or business use" notification.

For entertainment purposes, I researched working phone numbers that lead to various automated recordings.  For example, the official Santa Claus phone number and the Rickroll meme joke song.  At this current time of project creation, **all** of the mock "business location" phone numbers result in automated recordings and **none** of the numbers lead to a live phone.  Should anyone choose to call any of the phone numbers listed on the "Our Locations" page, I hope the resulting surprises bring smiles! üòÅ

Sales numbers, city names, and hours of operation were provided to students in the original school assignment, by Code Fellows Academy:  [Part 1](https://codefellows.github.io/code-201-guide/curriculum/class-06/lab/) , [Part 2](https://codefellows.github.io/code-201-guide/curriculum/class-07/lab/) , [Part 3](https://codefellows.github.io/code-201-guide/curriculum/class-09/lab/).

Addresses for the mock business locations correspond to what seemed like the most appropriately themed public locations (aquariums, etc.) in the required cities.
