This is a personal expansion of a previous school assignment.  The original Javascript homework had been a single page of mock sales data designed to integrate objects literals, constructor functions, tables, and forms.  I decided to expand the mock website into multiple pages to gain further practice with JavaScript and CSS.

## Sources

All images were obtained using the "Public Domain" filter on DuckDuckGo's image search, and were visually verified by me on the provider websites as being labelled with a "Public Domain License" and/or "free for personal or business use" notification.

For entertainment purposes, I researched working phone numbers that lead to various automated recordings.  For example, the official Santa Claus phone number and the Rickroll meme joke song.  At this current time of project creation, **all** of the numbers result in automated recordings and **none** of the numbers lead to a live phone.  Should anyone choose to call any of the numbers listed, I hope the resulting recordings bring smiles! üòÅ

Sales numbers, city names, and hours of operation had been provided to me in the original school assignment, from Code Fellows Academy:  [Part 1](https://codefellows.github.io/code-201-guide/curriculum/class-06/lab/) , [Part 2](https://codefellows.github.io/code-201-guide/curriculum/class-07/lab/) , [Part 3](https://codefellows.github.io/code-201-guide/curriculum/class-09/lab/).

Addresses used for the mock business locations belong to the most appropriately themed public locations (aquariums, etc.) I could easily find in the required cities.
